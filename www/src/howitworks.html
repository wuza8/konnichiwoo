        Gone are the days when language learners had to grapple with thousands of words out of context 
        just to start reading and listening in their target language. With this open-source program, you no longer need to go 
        through the tedious process of memorizing a vast vocabulary list. Our program is designed to store and present only 
        the words that are specifically used in a particular text, music, or book, enabling you to learn the words you need to 
        understand and engage with the content you're interested in.

        the most relevant vocabulary. This targeted approach ensures that you're equipped with the necessary 
        language skills to comprehend and enjoy the content at hand.
